# User Interface for the Correction of Software-Generated Beatgrids for Music

## Launching the App 

1. Go to the `dist/myapp/` folder.
2. Download `resources.neu`.
3. Download the executable binary corresponding to your computer's architecture. For instance, if you are on a Mac with an Intel chip, you should download the `myapp-mac_x64` binary. Alternatively, you can just download `myapp-release.zip` (in the `dist/` folder), which contains all the binaries.
4. Run the executable binary you downloaded. If you downloaded the zip file, make sure you are running the binary that corresponds to your computer's architecture.

If you are on a Mac and your computer will not let you run the binary because it cannot verify that it is free of malware, you can get around this by doing the following:
1. Open System Settings.
2. Go to Privacy & Security.
3. Scroll down to the very bottom.
4. There should be a warning about the executable that you tried to run and a button that says Open Anyway; press it.

## Other Requirements

In order for the app to work properly, the user must have exported an XML beatgrid file from [rekordbox](https://rekordbox.com/en/). This XML file can be obtained by opening rekordbox, going to File, and clicking Export Collection in xml format.

In order for the app to be able to load the beatgrid for a particular audio track, the audio track must be in the <i>same location</i> that it was in when it was loaded into rekordbox.

## Reminders

While using the app, saving your current beatgrid will overwrite the XML file generated by rekordbox; if you wish to keep the old XML file, please make a copy before saving.

If you load a new audio track before saving the beatgrid of the previous audio track, your changes to the beatgrid will be lost.
